# Simple exact diagoanlization library
This is exact diagonalization implementaions for for translational invariant Hamiltonians defined in simple lattices. 

## Exact diagonalization for one dimensional system

For simplicity, we only consider one dimensional translational invariance. We will consider $Z_2$ parity symmetry later.
